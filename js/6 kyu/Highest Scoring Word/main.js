/*
Description:
Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.

Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.

For example, the score of abad is 8 (1 + 2 + 1 + 4).

You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.

If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.

All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.

//Solution:
function high(x) {
  const wordsArray = x.split(' ');
  let highScore = 0;
  let highScoreWord = ' ';
  const alphabet = {
    a: 1,

    c: 3,
    d: 4,
    e: 5,
    f: 6,
    g: 7,
    h: 8,
    i: 9,
    j: 10,
    k: 11,
    l: 12,
    m: 13,
    n: 14,
