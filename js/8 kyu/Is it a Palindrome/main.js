/*
Description:
Write a function that checks if a given string (case insensitive) is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of symbols that reads the same backwards as forwards, such as madam or racecar, the date and time 12/21/33 12:21, and the sentence: "A man, a plan, a canal â€“ Panama".
*/

//Solution:

function isPalindrome(x) {
  let lowerCaseStr = x.toLowerCase();
  let reverseStr = lowerCaseStr.split('').reverse().join('');
  return lowerCaseStr === reverseStr;
}
